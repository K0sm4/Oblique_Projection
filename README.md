# Oblique projection

This is a MATLAB app that simulates the motion of a projectile, specifically a ball thrown at an angle from a given height. The app has several sliders that allow the user to adjust the initial velocity, launch angle, and mass of the ball. The app displays the trajectory of the ball in a 3D scatter plot, with the x-axis representing time, the y-axis representing horizontal distance, and the z-axis representing height.

The simulation is based on a numerical integration of the equations of motion for a projectile, taking into account the effects of air resistance on the ball's trajectory. The app uses the slider values to compute the initial velocity, launch angle, and mass of the ball, and then simulates the motion of the ball using a while loop that updates the position and velocity of the ball at each time step.

The app also uses a color map to display the height of the ball at each point along its trajectory. The color map is based on the maximum height achieved by the ball, with the highest point colored in red and the lowest point colored in blue. The app also includes a color bar that shows the percentage of the maximum height achieved at each point along the trajectory.

# How to use
The "MHprojekt" MATLAB app simulates a projectile motion of a ball thrown at an angle. The app has several sliders to adjust the parameters of the simulation:

"SiawyrzutuSlider": adjusts the initial velocity of the ball.
"KtwyrzutuSlider": adjusts the launch angle of the ball.
"MasapikiSlider": adjusts the mass of the ball.
To use the app, follow these steps:

Launch the "MHprojekt" app in MATLAB.
Adjust the sliders to set the desired parameters for the projectile motion.
Click the "StartSymulacjiButton" to start the simulation.
The app will display a 3D scatter plot showing the trajectory of the ball in space, as well as a color bar indicating the achieved height of the ball at each point in the trajectory.
Note that the simulation will run until the ball hits the ground, so the total simulation time may vary depending on the initial parameters.
